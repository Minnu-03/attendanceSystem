Traditional attendance systems can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and susceptible to proxy
attendances, where individuals falsely mark their presence in place of others. The "QR Code Attendance
System" is a fast, efficient, and user-friendly solution for tracking attendance through QR codes,
specifically designed to address these challenges. By leveraging web-based technology, it automates and
streamlines the attendance process, significantly reducing the likelihood of attendance manipulation. Built
with HTML, CSS, and Django, the system offers a seamless, real-time interface for marking presence. It
operates within a local network environment. Key features include Automatic IP Fetching, which
retrieves the teacher's IPv4 address to generate the QR code, and a Faculty Panel that enables educators to
identify and eliminate proxy attendances. This ensures that only legitimate attendance is recorded,
enhancing the accuracy of the system. Additionally, it provides a straightforward interface for ease of use,
real-time tracking through QR code scanning, and quick access for managing attendance records.
