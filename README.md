Traditional attendance systems can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and susceptible to proxy
attendances, where individuals falsely mark their presence instead of others. The "QR Code Attendance
System" is a fast, efficient, and user-friendly solution for tracking attendance through QR codes designed to address these challenges. Leveraging web-based technology automates and streamlines the attendance process, significantly reducing the likelihood of attendance manipulation. Built
with HTML, CSS, and Django, the system offers a seamless, real-time interface for marking presence. It operates within a local network environment. Key features include Automatic IP Fetching, generates the QR code, and a Faculty Panel that enables educators to identify and eliminate proxy attendances. This ensures that only legitimate attendance is recorded, enhancing the accuracy of the system. Additionally, it provides a straightforward interface for ease of use, real-time tracking through QR code scanning, and quick access for managing attendance records.
